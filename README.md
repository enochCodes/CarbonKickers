## Overview

Welcome to the Video Authenticity Detection Challenge repository! This project focuses on developing an advanced video authenticity detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The goal is to distinguish genuine videos from manipulated or deepfake content through a combination of facial recognition, voice analysis, and sophisticated temporal checks.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Modal Authentication:** Combining facial, voice, and other biometric features for comprehensive video authentication.
- **Temporal Analysis:** Detecting anomalies over time, including unnatural motion patterns, gaze direction, and emotional consistency.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizing state-of-the-art deep learning models for face detection, facial recognition, and more.
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Enhancing video analysis with challenge-response tests and user interaction verification.
- **Data Processing and Analysis:** A modular structure for data processing, feature extraction, and analysis, promoting code maintainability and scalability.

## File Structure

The project is organized into distinct directories for clear separation of concerns:

- **data/:** Raw and processed video data, metadata.
- **models/:** Pre-trained and custom models.
- **src/:** Source code organized by modules (preprocessing, feature extraction, analysis, authentication, and utilities).
- **tests/:** Unit tests, integration tests, and test data.
- **results/:** Logs, visualizations, and reports.

For a detailed explanation, please refer to the [File Structure](path/to/README#file-structure) section in the documentation.
